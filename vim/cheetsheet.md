# VIM CHEETSHEET

Generel stuff that I need to get into my muscle memory.

## surround
* `cs"'` - changes surrouding " to '

## Grepper

* `<leader>g` - kick off
* without entering anything, takes word under the cursor

## GitGutter

* `]c`, `[c` - jump to next/prev hunk (*c*hange)
* `<leader>hs` - stage hunk
* `<leader>hu` - undo hunk

## Debugging

* `<leader>DD` - start profiling
* `<leader>DP` - pause profiling, output in `profile.log`
